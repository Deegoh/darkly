# Vulnerability

User agent strings are pieces of information sent by web browsers to identify themselves to web servers.

# Identification

# Resolve

curl -A "ft_bornToSec" -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" "http://192.168.1.31/?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f" | grep "flag"

# Prevent

- Implement strict input validation for user agent strings
- Sanitize user agent data before using it in any operations
- Avoid directly using raw user agent input in critical functions
