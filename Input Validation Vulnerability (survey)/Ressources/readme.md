# Vulnerability
This vulnerability occurs when an application fails to properly check and sanitize user input,
allowing potentially malicious data to enter the system.


# Identification

Exploring code source. I try to change value's form

# Resolve

Inspect code, go to input, change value from options.
On this case, the value is post when value is changed.

# Prevent

- Server-Side Validation: Always perform input validation on the server side, not just client-side.
- Early Validation: Validate input as early as possible in the data flow.
- Contextual Validation: Consider the specific context of the input when applying validation rules.
